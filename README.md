# NLP Bangla Workshop Paper
This is a combined workshop paper repo for The First Bangla Language Processing Workshop (BLP 2023) Co-located with EMNLP 2023 in Singapore.

Our paper has not been accepted. We have decided to make minor changes as suggested by the reviewers and upload to the Archive. Overall, it was a good hands on practise for me to get exposure to NLP with the help of my mentor Ishrak Hayet, who guided me throughout the journey of the work. 

Collaborators: Ishraq Hayet, RokunuzJahan Rudro
